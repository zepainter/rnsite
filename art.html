            <img class="thumbnail charart" src="lib/art/gold-protag-small.jpg" alt="digital drawing of an androgynous Asian person striding forward with their head up, eyes closed, and hands outspread; there are gold cracks on their right hand and forearm, left wrist, and their throat; stars spin around their hands and clouds billow in the background">
          </div>
          <div class="artdesc">This is a character in one of my short stories, possibly my favorite of all my short stories.  It tackles some issues close to my heart.  I won't say more—don't want to spoil anything.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="artworkdiv">
          <div class="thumbnaildiv">
            <img class="thumbnail charart" src="lib/art/yeshet-tetziryah-small.jpg" alt="digital drawing of a young non-binary person sitting under a ceiba tree and looking up, with a large raptor (dinosaur) resting beside zim with its head in zer lap; both are dappled in golden sunlight coming through tree leaves above">
          </div>
          <div class="artdesc">This is Yeshet and zer raptor Tetziryah.  Yeshet's one of the major characters in "What Springs from Bloodied Earth," a non-binary magician with a knack for animals.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="artworkdiv">
          <div class="thumbnaildiv">
            <img class="thumbnail charart" src="lib/art/sinhi-jaksa-small.jpg" alt="digital drawing of two people; left, an androgynous dark-skinned person in a military uniform holding a saber, in shades of indigo over a white background; right, a woman wearing a dupatta, holding an aruval and a pistol, in shades of orange over a black background">
          </div>
          <div class="artdesc">Sinhi and Jaksa, Sync protagonists, siblings who have crossed paths for the first time in decades and don't know whether they're on the same side.  (Technically, half-siblings, but they never really cared about the "half" part except as a means of allaying all the "Wow, you look nothing alike!" comments.)</div>
        </div>
        <div class="artworkdiv">
          <div class="thumbnaildiv">
            <img class="thumbnail charart" src="lib/art/preparing-a-turkey-small.jpg" alt="digital drawing of two Indigenous characters; one is preparing a turkey for cooking and says, 'You wanna try?'  The other says, 'I'm not sticking my hand in that.'">
          </div>
          <div class="artdesc">A couple of the protagonists of Dust and Lightning, ostensibly preparing a meal together.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="artworkdiv">
          <div class="thumbnaildiv">
            <img class="thumbnail charart" src="lib/art/corinne-small.jpg" alt="digital drawing of a slender Black woman with dreads wearing headphones and typing at a computer">
          </div>
          <div class="artdesc">This is Corinne, a secondary character in Sync.  She's autistic, very gay, and almost as obsessed with computers as with obscure audio romances.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="artworkdiv">
          <div class="thumbnaildiv">
            <img class="thumbnail charart" src="lib/art/jaksa-colored-pencil-small.jpg" alt="colored pencil sketch of Jaksa, an older woman with curly black hair, a hooked nose, and a prosthetic left arm, with arms crossed, eyes closed, and a relaxed smile">
          </div>
          <div class="artdesc">A colored pencil sketch of Jaksa, one of the protagonists in Sync, in a rare calm moment.  You can probably tell, I still haven't really got the hang of drawing those ringlet curls, but I'll get it eventually.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="artworkdiv">
          <div class="thumbnaildiv">
            <img class="thumbnail charart" src="lib/art/name-of-universe-small.jpg" alt="digital drawing of an old glowing Black woman reaching up to the face of a silver titan that blends into the spacy background, heavily stylized">
          </div>
          <div class="artdesc">This was originally an illustration for a flash fiction piece I wrote several years ago, but I rather like it in its own right.  It was also originally done in markers; trust me, this digital version is much cleaner.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="artworkdiv">
          <div class="thumbnaildiv">
            <img class="thumbnail otherart" src="lib/art/dragon-mechanic-small.jpg" alt="pencil and ink drawing of a young Indian woman holding the head of a mechanical dragon perched on the broken wing of a plane">
          </div>
          <div class="artdesc">This isn't tied to any specific story, just something I drew for the heck of it.  Who needs an excuse for cool dragons and their mechanics?</div>
        </div>
        <div class="artworkdiv">
          <div class="thumbnaildiv">
            <img class="thumbnail charart" src="lib/art/sahar-asra-small.jpg" alt="digital drawing of two young Black women; at left, Sahar, in white and cream-colored armor, standing in a defensive stance and holding a sword; at right, Asra, sparkly teal dress and rose headdress, smiling as she reaches toward the sun">
          </div>
          <div class="artdesc">Sahar and Asra, from a novellete of mine that starts with a twist on the Sleeping Beauty premise and then leaps off in new directions.  I'm not normally much for fairytales, but I'd be lying if I said I don't have a soft spot for some good queer fantasy romance here and there.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="artworkdiv">
          <div class="thumbnaildiv">
            <img class="thumbnail charart" src="lib/art/jaksa-saeed-small.jpg" alt="digital drawing of two people sparring; Saeed at left dodges a punch from Jaksa at right; Saeed is a thickly built man with a goatee and a scar on his leg, and Jaksa is an older woman with curly hair and one arm; the scar on the shoulder of her missing arm can be seen">
          </div>
          <div class="artdesc">Jaksa, Sync protagonist, sparring with her pilot Saeed.  They spar regularly, and she splits it 50/50 whether to spar with or without her prosthetic arm; she likes to be able to hold her own in a fight either way.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="artworkdiv">
          <div class="thumbnaildiv">
            <img class="thumbnail charart" src="lib/art/demon-catcher-small.jpg" alt="stylized digital drawing of an old Black woman in a neon green dress; at left, a full-body image where she stands smirking with shadowy animals, a monkey, a large cat, and several butterflies; at right, her head and shoulders, with the shadowy monkey perched on her shoulder and fingering her beaded earring; she looks at the monkey and says 'How many times I tell you don't play with my earrings!'">
          </div>
          <div class="artdesc">This is the Demon Catcher!  She only makes a brief appearance in one of my short stories, but she's such a good character, I ought to write more with her.</div>
