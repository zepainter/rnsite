        <p class="initialp" tabindex="0">I've never been terribly consistent about making art, but now and then I get in the mood to draw up some of my characters.  Click on any of the images below for a close-up.</p>
        <p tabindex="0">Besides character art, I also sometimes make abstract art, paintings, jewelry, and whatever else catches my interest.  If you like, you can check out my art site, <a class="smalllink unbold" href="https://www.neitherwise.com">Neitherwise</a>, to see more.  I also have a <a class="smalllink unbold" href="riley-neither.redbubble.com" target="_blank">Redbubble shop</a> where you can get some of my designs printed on just about anything.</p>

      <div class="textbox">
        <h2 tabindex="0">Short Stories & Miscellaneous</h2>
        <p class="initialp">Some of these drawings are related to specific short stories I've written, and some are just SFF for the fun of it.</p>
        <div class="artdiv"><img class="artimg" tabindex="0" src="lib/art/gold-protag.png" alt="digital drawing of an androgynous Asian person striding forward with their head up, eyes closed, and hands outspread; there are gold cracks on their right hand and forearm, left wrist, and their throat; stars spin around their hands and clouds billow in the background"></div>
        <p>This is a character in my short story <a class="smalllink unbold" href="https://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/stories/imagine-a-thief-with-golden-fire-in-their-voice/" target="_blank">Imagine a Thief with Golden Fire in Their Voice</a>.  I won't say moreâ€”you'll have to read the story!</p>
        <div class="artdiv"><img class="artimg" tabindex="0" src="lib/art/name-of-universe.jpg" alt="digital drawing of an old glowing Black woman reaching up to the face of a silver titan that blends into the spacy background, heavily stylized"></div>
        <p>This was originally an illustration for a flash fiction piece I wrote several years ago, but I rather like it in its own right.  It was also originally done in markers; trust me, this digital version is much cleaner.</p>
        <div class="artdiv"><img class="artimg" tabindex="0" src="lib/art/dragon-mechanic.jpg" alt="pencil and ink drawing of a young Indian woman holding the head of a mechanical dragon perched on the broken wing of a plane"></div>
        <p>This isn't tied to any specific story, just something I drew for the heck of it.  Who needs an excuse for cool dragons and their mechanics?</p>
        <div class="artdiv"><img class="artimg" tabindex="0" src="lib/art/sahar-asra.jpg" alt="digital drawing of two young Black women; at left, Sahar, in white and cream-colored armor, standing in a defensive stance and holding a sword; at right, Asra, sparkly teal dress and rose headdress, smiling as she reaches toward the sun"></div>
        <p>Sahar and Asra, from a novellete of mine that starts with a twist on the Sleeping Beauty premise and then leaps off in new directions.  I'm not normally much for fairytales, but I'd be lying if I said I don't have a soft spot for some good queer fantasy romance here and there.</p>
        <div class="artdiv"><img class="artimg" tabindex="0" src="lib/art/demon-catcher.jpg" alt="stylized digital drawing of an old Black woman in a neon green dress; at left, a full-body image where she stands smirking with shadowy animals, a monkey, a large cat, and several butterflies; at right, her head and shoulders, with the shadowy monkey perched on her shoulder and fingering her beaded earring; she looks at the monkey and says 'How many times I tell you don't play with my earrings!'"></div>
        <p>This is the Demon Catcher!  Early conception of a character who has since grown off in other directions, so this illustration isn't entirely accurate anymore, but I still like it.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="textbox">
        <h2 tabindex="0">Works in Progress</h2>
        <p class="initialp">Some character art from longer works in progress.</p>
        <div class="artdiv"><img class="artimg" tabindex="0" src="lib/art/yexet-tetziryah.png" alt="digital drawing of a young non-binary person sitting under a ceiba tree and looking up, with a large raptor (dinosaur) resting beside zim with its head in zer lap; both are dappled in golden sunlight coming through tree leaves above"></div>
        <p>This is Yexet and zer raptor Tetziryah.  Yexet's one of the major characters in <em>What Springs from Bloodied Earth</em>, a non-binary magician with a knack for animals.</p>
        <div class="artdiv"><img class="artimg" tabindex="0" src="lib/art/sinhi-jaksa.jpg" alt="digital drawing of two people; left, an androgynous dark-skinned person in a military uniform holding a saber, in shades of indigo over a white background; right, a woman wearing a dupatta, holding an aruval and a pistol, in shades of orange over a black background"></div>
        <p>Sinhi and Jaksa, Sync protagonists, siblings who have crossed paths for the first time in decades and don't know whether they're on the same side.  (Technically, half-siblings, but they never really cared about the "half" part except as a means of allaying all the "Wow, you look nothing alike!" comments.)</p>
        <div class="artdiv"><img class="artimg" tabindex="0" src="lib/art/jaksa-saeed.jpg" alt="digital drawing of two people sparring; Saeed at left dodges a punch from Jaksa at right; Saeed is a thickly built man with a goatee and a scar on his leg, and Jaksa is an older woman with curly hair and one arm; the scar on the shoulder of her missing arm can be seen"></div>
        <p>Jaksa, sparring with her pilot Saeed.  They spar regularly, and she splits it 50/50 whether to spar with or without her prosthetic arm; she likes to be able to hold her own in a fight either way.</p>
        <div class="artdiv"><img class="artimg" tabindex="0" src="lib/art/corinne.jpg" alt="digital drawing of a slender Black woman with dreads wearing headphones and typing at a computer"></div>
        <p>A secondary character in Sync, Jaksa's programmer.</p>
        <div class="artdiv"><img class="artimg" tabindex="0" src="lib/art/preparing-a-turkey.jpg" alt="digital drawing of two Indigenous characters; one is preparing a turkey for cooking and says, 'You wanna try?'  The other says, 'I'm not sticking my hand in that.'"></div>
        <p>A couple of the protagonists of Dust and Lightning, ostensibly preparing a meal together.</p>
