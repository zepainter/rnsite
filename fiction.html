        <h2 tabindex="0">WIP: Dust &amp; Lightning</h2>
        <p>Light Shatters is already a city like no other, a precarious balance of innovation and tradition where there is no barrier between the physical and the spiritual.  When a storm of wild magic hits, it becomes the center of a world-changing disaster.  From the infamous inventor who just came into town to a healer with heavy secrets and a Bear Clan girl whose family runs a riverside restaurant, disparate and unlikely people are pulled into much bigger things than they're prepared to handle.  The magic their world is built on is dying, and only when their paths intersect do they begin to see a way forward.</p>
        <p class="finalp">A science fantasy duology with a dash of queer romance, <em>Sky of Dust</em> and <em>World of Lightning</em> follow four characters dealing with personal traumas at the same time that they're forced to face up to some uncomfortable truths about their world.  The story deals heavily with family and community, trauma and healing, and tradition and growth, with a queer and Haudenosaunee-coded cast.</p>

        <h2 tabindex="0">WIP: Sync</h2>
        <p>This stand-alone sci-fi novel is full of queer characters in an ethnically and religiously diverse setting.  It still doesn't have a proper title ("Sync" is just a placeholder), but here's the back-cover blurb:</p>
        <p class="finalp">Sinhi and Jaksa grew up together in the Network Republic of Shukra, the most powerful state on un-terraformed Venus and one with dark stains in its not-so-distant history.  When they each realized the evils their home was responsible for, they reacted very differently: Sinhi devoted zimself to fixing the Network from within, while Jaksa devoted herself to defending the outliers.  When they cross paths unexpectedly for the first time in decades, it isn't clear whether they ought to be allies or enemies, and with ground-breaking medical technology, a brewing uprising, and the torturous practices of the Network's military all caught in the balance, there's much more at stake than their last chance at family.</p>

      <div class="textbox">
        <h2>WIP: Gods of Bloodied Earth</h2>
        <p>This is a trio of novellas about the gods of a colonized people.  The setting is largely inspired by Central America, with the significant exception that it's also inhabited by late Cretaceous dinosaurs, some of which have been domesticated.  The novellas aren't a series, exactly, since each one focuses on different characters and plots and there's substantial time between them, but there is a definite sequence to them.</p>
        <p class="finalp"><em>What Springs from Bloodied Earth</em></p>
        <p>After a brutal invasion, the only gods left to the Etliruset people are gods of death, but they are determined not to let their people die.</p>
        <p class="finalp">The next two will be titled <em>What Blossoms from Steel Seeds</em> and <em>What Rises Like the Sun Undying</em>.  I won't say too much about them, lest I spoil the first one!</p>
