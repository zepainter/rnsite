        <p class="initialp" tabindex="0">Sometime in college, I realized I had never once read a SFF novel with a trans person in it.  When I went looking for such books, I found a lot of disappointment—a lot of speculative substitutes for trans people, like third-sexed aliens and magical body-swapping, and a lot of stuff that was just obviously written by cis people who didn't know what they were talking about.  I started keeping a list of the few books I found that I thought actually had good representations of non-cisnormative gender.</p>
        <p>Since the, trans characters and trans authors have both been making ourselves known in SFF, so much so that I can no longer keep up!  But it wasn't that long ago that books like these were all but impossible to find, so I'll keep my list going to play my part in sharing them.  These are SFF novels with trans, non-binary, and trans-ish major characters that I, as a trans and non-binary reader, really enjoyed.  I particularly recommend the ones with stars, and you can find more in-depth reviews for many of them on <a class="smalllink" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/150585305-riley-neither" target="_blank">my Goodreads page</a>.</p>

        <h2 tabindex="0">SFF with Genuine Trans &amp; Non-Binary Protagonists</h2>
        <h3 class="initialh3 finalp"><span class="unbold">&#9733</span> <em>Light from Uncommon Stars</em> by Ryka Aoki <span class="unbold">(trans author!)</span></h3>
        <p>A runaway trans girl who loves playing violin crosses paths with a violin teacher who sells her students' souls to Hell.  This book engages deeply with themes of marginalization, abuse, music, found family, and changing your destiny, and does so with a humorously matter-of-fact genre mash-up.  There was very little about it that I didn't love.</p>
        <h3 class="initialh3 finalp"><span class="unbold">&#9733</span> <em>Dreadnought</em> by April Daniels <span class="unbold">(trans author!)</span></h3>
        <p>A closeted trans girl accidentally inherits superpowers that give her the body she's always wanted.  Superheroes and YA aren't my usual genre, but this book is compellingly written and deals with both trans issues and family issues in a very real, relatable way.</p>
        <h3 class="finalp"><span class="unbold">&#9733</span> <em>The Bruising of Qilwa</em> by Naseem Jamnia <span class="unbold">(non-binary author!)</span></h3>
        <p>This is a queernormative Persian-inspired fantasy with a non-binary lead and a trans secondary character, and the author does a fantastic job of fully developing their identities and weaving those identities into other themes and conflicts in the book without ever introducing any transphobia into the world.</p>
        <h3 class="finalp"><span class="unbold">&#9733</span> <em>Raven Stratagem</em> and <em>Revenant Gun</em> by Yoon Ha Lee <span class="unbold">(trans author!)</span></h3>
        <p>These are books two and three of a series about a tyrannical space empire.  One of the main characters in these two books is a trans man, and several secondary characters are also trans or non-binary.  They weren't present in the first book (which was limited to a context that, in-world, is more transphobic than most), and their transness doesn't play much of a role in the plot; they just exist, because why wouldn't trans people exist in space?  Unlike the other late-in-series books I mention here, I don't recommend picking up these without first reading the first in the series (<em>Ninefox Gambit</em>).</p>
        <h3 class="finalp"><span class="unbold">&#9733</span> <em>Sordidez</em> by E.G. Conde&#769;</h3>
        <p>This book has an unusual structure and different parts of it really have different protagonists, but the beginning and end focus on a Puerto Rican trans man trying to balance different aspects of his self-identity in the midst of near-future climate crises and Indigenous revival.</p>
        <h3 class="finalp"><span class="unbold">&#9733</span> <em>Hell Followed With Us</em> by Andrew Joseph White</h3>
        <p>YA fantasy horror with a trans protagonist and an autistic love interest, tackling themes of religious and familial trauma.</p>
        <h3 class="finalp"><span class="unbold">&#9733</span> <em>Full Fathom Five</em> by Max Gladstone</h3>
        <p>This one's got a trans woman co-protagonist, and it's probably one of the best examples I've found of a trans character written by a cis author.  Her transness isn't part of the story (which is about a colonized island's dying artificial gods), but it is a vibrant part of her character, without being all that she is.  There were a few (non-queer-related) things about the book that didn't sit well with me, but overall, I definitely enjoyed it.  It's one of a set of stand-alone novels that all take place in the same world (the Craft Sequence), and it works well with the others or on its own.  The same character is also a co-protagonist in <em>The Ruin of Angels</em>, but in that one, the fact that she's trans is more "blink and you'll miss it;" that one also definitely benefits from reading some of the other Craft books first.</p>
        <h3 class="finalp"><em>Broken Stone</em> by Jameson Rivera <span class="unbold">(trans author!)</span></h3>
        <p>Okay, I'll be honest: this is an obscure indie novel that I only know about because the author is a friend, so take my recommendation with a grain of salt, if you must.  But if you want trans fantasy protagonists, this book will give you two (both trans men), plus several queer secondary characters including an enby and a trans woman, all striving to throw off an imperial regime and revive an ancient god.</p>
        <h3 class="finalp"><em>A Psalm for the Wild-Built</em> and its sequel by Becky Chambers</h3>
        <p>This is a cute little story about a monk and a robot traveling together.  The monk uses singular "they" pronouns, and that's all there is to it; their identity is never something that has to be questioned or explained.</p>
        <h3 class="finalp"><em>Not Your Villain</em> by C.B. Lee</h3>
        <p>Another YA trans superhero, and a bunch of other characters are also queer; this book is brimming with wholesome representation.  Second in a series, but the other books focus on other (cis) characters.</p>
        <h3 class="finalp"><em>The Bone Palace</em> by Amanda Downum</h3>
        <p class="finalp">One of the two protagonists in this book was called a hijra, but the way she was written felt very much like a Western trans woman to me—not that I, as a white American, am the best judge on how to write hijras.  Either way, she's not cis, and the book's not a bad read, though she has to play second fiddle to her cis co-protagonist, around whom the series revolves.  This book is second in the series, but stands alright on its own.</p>

        <h2 tabindex="0">SFF with Trans &amp; Non-Binary Leads in Speculative Cultures</h2>
        <p>These are stories with characters who, if they existed in our world, would almost certainly be trans and/or non-binary, but who exist in settings with very different social/cultural takes on gender than ours, in ways that influence how the characters understand themselves and relate to gender.  It might mean they're not quite as relateable as the characters in the books above, but they're still a refreshing divergence from cisnormative protagonists, and the exploration of gender in the world-building is wonderful in its own right.</p>
        <h3 class="finalp"><span class="unbold">&#9733</span> The <em>Tensorate</em> books by Neon Yang <span class="unbold">(non-binary author!)</span></h3>
        <p class="finalp">In this world, children are considered genderless (and puberty is blocked via magic) until they choose whether they'll be men or women.  There are several trans and non-binary characters, including the protagonist in <em>The Black Tides of Heaven</em> and secondary characters throughout the series, and I enjoyed the way gender and identity were handled.</p>
        <h3 class="finalp"><span class="unbold">&#9733</span> <em>An Unkindness of Ghosts</em> by Rivers Solomon <span class="unbold">(non-binary author!)</span></h3>
        <p class="finalp">This takes place on a spaceship on a generations-long journey, where gender has become tied up with social class and locality, and the (autistic) protagonist is hard to read as cis.  Wrapped up with lots of other intriguing world-building and relevant social themes, it made for a fascinating read.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="textbox">
        <h2 tabindex="0">SFF with Good Trans-Ish Protagonists</h2>
        <p>By "trans-ish," I mean that there's some speculative element tied up with the character's identity in a way that makes it hard to say they're really just trans, but not in a way that I found othering or problematic, or I wouldn't be recommending it.</p>
        <h3 class="initialh3 finalp"><span class="unbold">&#9733</span> <em>Freshwater</em> by Akwaeke Emezi <span class="unbold">(non-binary author!)</span></h3>
        <p>When I first read this book, my understanding was that the author and protagonist are both non-binary.  The protagonist's experience of gender is tied up with the experience of being possessed by spirits, but I read this as a speculative or metaphorical element.  I've since learned that it may be a more literal representation of the author's spirituality and their understanding of their own gender, which they consider different from Western trans or non-binary genders.  The book is certainly more spiritual (and also more sexually explicit) than I usually veer toward, and it deals with some very heavy themes, but I found it a compelling and thought-provoking read overall.</p>
        <h3 class="initialh3 finalp"><span class="unbold">&#9733</span> <em>When the Angels Left the Old Country</em> by Sacha Lamb<span class="unbold"></span></h3>
        <p>A Jewish angel and demon travel together to America in the early twentieth century.  The demon is generally content to be a boy, but the angel has a much harder time with human gender... and human-ness in general.  I found this story and the relationships in it very sweet.</p>
        <h3 class="finalp"><span class="unbold">&#9733</span> <em>Ancillary Justice</em> and its sequels by Ann Leckie</h3>
        <p>The protagonist of this series was once an AI that inhabited a spaceship and, simultaneously, a large host of (stolen) human bodies, until the ship and all but one of those bodies were destroyed.  The series offers a really unique handling of gender and its role in culture from the perspective of a character who truly just doesn't care about it (their own or anyone else's) the way humans usually do.  It's also just an all-around excellent space opera.</p>
        <h3 class="finalp"><span class="unbold">&#9733</span> <em>Bone Dance</em> by Emma Bull</h3>
        <p>This was the first book I ever found with a protagonist who I could really relate to on a gender level.  It sort of swept me off my feet to finally see that part of myself reflected in a story, and I raced through the book in two days.  There turn out to be speculative reasons for the protagonist to be non-binary, and it isn't perfect—what book is?—but it will always have a special place in my heart.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="textbox">
        <h2 tabindex="0">Honorable Mentions</h2>
        <h3 class="finalp"><em>The Courier's New Bicycle</em> by Kim Westwood</h3>
        <p>I have very mixed feelings about this book.  On the one hand, a trans enby bike-riding protagonist in a cool dystopic near-future!  On the other, a pretty sketchy conflation of gender-affirming hormones with mind-altering and addictive substances, and that's not even the sketchiest thing in the book.  It's worth a mention, I think, but I didn't like this one nearly as much as I wanted to.</p>
        <h3 class="finalp"><em>Diana Comet and Other Improbable Stories</em> by Sandra McDonald</h3>
        <p>This is a collection of short stories that very loosely center around the titular character, a trans woman.  Sometimes she's the protagonist, sometimes not.  There were multiple scenes of other characters accidentally seeing something that revealed her trans-ness, and I'm really not a fan of forcibly outing trans characters like that, but otherwise, it wasn't bad.</p>
        <h3 class="finalp">Trans (Ish) Secondary Characters</h3>
        <p>These won't give you a lot if you're really itching for trans representation, but sometimes it's nice to see trans and non-binary folks existing in the background, too.</p>
        <p class="indented finalp">&#8226; <em>To Be Taught, If Fortunate</em> by Becky Chambers: trans man</p>
        <p class="indented finalp">&#8226; <em>No Man's Land</em> by A.J. Fitzwater: trans-ish (trans woman, but this is associated with a magical animal-shifting ability)</p>
        <p class="indented finalp">&#8226; <em>Last First Snow</em> by Max Gladstone: trans man</p>
        <p class="indented finalp">&#8226; <em>The Water Outlaws</em> by S. L. Huang: several trans, non-binary, or gender-nonconforming characters</p>
        <p class="indented finalp">&#8226; <em>The Fifth Season</em> and its sequels by N. K. Jemisin: trans woman</p>
        <p class="indented finalp">&#8226; <em>A Ruin of Shadows</em> by L. D. Lewis: trans-ish (shape-shifting djinni with they/them pronouns)</p>
        <p class="indented finalp">&#8226; <em>A Snake Falls to Earth</em> by Darcie Little Badger: non-binary (they/them pronouns)</p>
        <p class="indented finalp">&#8226; <em>Black Sun</em> by Rebecca Roanhorse: two non-binary characters (xe/xir pronouns) and a trans woman</p>
        <p class="indented finalp">&#8226; <em>Poison Study</em> by Maria Snyder: trans man</p>
      </div>

      <div class="textbox">
        <p class="initialp finalp" tabindex="0">If you know a SFF novel with trans (ish) characters that you don't see here, it might be because I didn't think it handled things well and I don't want to recommend it.  This was often the case with older sci-fi novels that might have had progressive takes on gender fifty or sixty years ago but haven't aged well.  That said, it also might be because I don't know the book you're thinking of, especially if it's newer or by a lesser-known author, and I'd love for you to tell me about it!</p>
