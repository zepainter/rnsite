        <p tabindex="0">Writer of speculative fiction that's often queer, sometimes political, and always full of wonder.  Ze/zim/zer or they/them/their, please.  My first short story is forthcoming in Fireside Magazine, and in the meantime, I offer art, conlangs (constructed languages), and book recs with an eye for trans representation in SFF.</p>

        <h3 tabindex="0">About me</h3>
        <p>I'm non-binary, asexual, autistic, and anti-fascist.  I'm also a white settler living on Gayogo&#817;h√≥:n&#491;&#8311; (Cayuga) land.  I say so because these things influence my writing.  I believe in the value of representation for the disempowered, and I believe in the power of fiction to move people and ultimately move societies.  So I tend to write stories with a lot of queer, PoC, neurodiverse characters, exploring themes of identity and family, survival and recovery, self-determination, resistance, and justice.  And I like to wrap it all together with magic and majesty, physics and futures, with that speculative sense of wonder and vastness that reminds you we're all part of something bigger than ourselves.</p>
        <p>I'm a grad student in linguistics, originally from Omaha NE and currently living in Ithaca NY.  When I can find the time between writing fiction and writing my dissertation, I like to make art, ride bikes, and teach myself web development.  (Like the site?  Why thanks, I made it myself!)</p>
        <p>I've never been much good at social media, I'm afraid, but you can find more art on my Instagram or email me at riley.neither<span class="empty">@</span>gmail.com.</p>

        <h3 tabindex="0">Regarding pronouns</h3>
        <p>I'll accept most any gender-neutral pronouns (other than "it"), so if there's a set you're already familiar with, feel free to use those for me.  All else being equal, though, I prefer ze/zim/zer, and so do some of my characters.  They work like this:</p>
