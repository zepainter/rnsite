        <h2 tabindex="0">About</h2>
        <p>I'm non-binary, asexual, neurodivergent, and anti-fascist.  I'm also a white settler in the U.S. and have lived most of my life on Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#704; (Cayuga) and Umo<sup>n</sup>ho<sup>n</sup> (Omaha) & Otoe-Missouria land.  I say so because these things influence my writing.  I believe in the value of representation for the disempowered, and I believe in the power of fiction to move people and ultimately move societies.  So I tend to write stories with a lot of queer, PoC, neurodiverse characters, exploring themes of identity and family, survival and recovery, resistance, justice, and self-determination.  And I like to wrap it all together with magic and majesty, physics and futures, with that speculative sense of wonder and vastness that reminds us we're all part of something bigger than ourselves.</p>
        <img id="selfportrait" src="lib/imgs/self-portrait.png" alt="a stylized portrait of Riley Neither, an androgynous white person with long hair and glasses">
        <p>After earning a PhD in linguistics, I took up copy editing for an educational non-profit, and I recently joined that non-profit's research team.  When I'm not writing queer fantasy and sci-fi or occasionally venturing into other genres, I also make art and conlangs (constructed languages), read books, ride bikes, and sing in a queer chorus.</p>
        <h3>Find me around</h3>
        <p>My particular neurodivergences make social media difficult for me, but I try to check in there periodically.  A better way to reach me is by email, riley.neither<span class="empty">@</span>gmail.com.</p>

        <h3 tabindex="0">Pronouns &amp; pronunciations</h3>
        <p>Gender-neutral pronouns, please.  I'll accept most any (other than "it"), so if there's a set you're already familiar with (like singular "they"), feel free to use those for me.  All else being equal, though, I prefer ze/zim/zer, and so do some of my characters.  They work like this:</p>
        <div class="tablediv" id="pronountable"><table class="basict">

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="spacedcol">zim</td>
            <td class="spacedcol">~ her/him/them</td>
            <td>You might still catch zim at it now and then.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="spacedcol">zer</td>
            <td class="spacedcol">~ her/his/their</td>

            <td class="spacedcol">~ hers/his/theirs</td>
            <td>This flute is too shiny to be zers.</td>
          </tr>

            <td class="spacedcol">~ herself/himself/themself</td>
