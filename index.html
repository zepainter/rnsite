        <p>My latest story is live in Beneath Ceaseless Skies, with a non-binary protagonist, a unique magic system, and a powerful exploration of abuse and the fight to reclaim one's voice in its aftermath.  This might be my favorite of all the short fiction I've written so far.</p>
        <h3 class="finalp">New Story: <a class="smalllink" href="https://firesidefiction.com/give-my-body-to-the-moths" target="_blank">Give My Body to the Moths</a></h3>
        <p>My first published story is live in Fireside!  This poetic, anti-fascist flash fic looks at finding the will to fight back, even when you've already given in before.</p>

      <div class="textbox">
        <h2 tabindex="0">About me</h2>
        <p>I'm non-binary, asexual, autistic, and anti-fascist.  I'm also a white settler living (until very recently) on Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#704; (Cayuga) land.  I say so because these things influence my writing.  I believe in the value of representation for the disempowered, and I believe in the power of fiction to move people and ultimately move societies.  So I tend to write stories with a lot of queer, PoC, neurodiverse characters, exploring themes of identity and family, survival and recovery, resistance, justice, and self-determination.  And I like to wrap it all together with magic and majesty, physics and futures, with that speculative sense of wonder and vastness that reminds you we're all part of something bigger than ourselves.</p>
        <p>I recently earned a PhD in linguistics and am currently doing some freelance editing work.  Besides writing fiction, I also like to make art and conlangs (constructed languages), read books, ride bikes, and teach myself web development.  (Like the site?  Why thanks, I made it myself!)  I pronounce the Neither part of my name with the first vowel like "eye," not like "see."</p>
        <h3>Find me around</h3>
        <p>I've never been much good at social media, I'm afraid, but you can find me anywhere below or email me at riley.neither<span class="empty">@</span>gmail.com.</p>

        <h3 tabindex="0">Regarding pronouns</h3>
        <p>Gender-neutral pronouns, please.  I'll accept most any (other than "it"), so if there's a set you're already familiar with (like singular "they"), feel free to use those for me.  All else being equal, though, I prefer ze/zim/zer, and so do some of my characters.  They work like this:</p>
